## About Me
I started my journey in psychology, but my curiosity for technology led me to train as a full-stack web developer. This experience provided me with a solid foundation on how web applications, clients, servers, and databases work together. However, my true passion lies in cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

My background in psychology offers a unique perspective in cybersecurity, allowing me to analyze social engineering tactics and develop defense strategies adapted to human behavior.

I am constantly learning about vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, and strategies to mitigate risks in digital environments. My goal is to detect and prevent threats before they become real problems.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me practicing contact sports or playing board games.
